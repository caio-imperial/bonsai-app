  Feature Page Components are the main UI composition units of any feature.
  They orchestrate feature hooks and subcomponents, manage layout, and are imported by pages.

# Rule: Feature View Components orchestrate hooks and UI for a feature

Feature View Components should:

1. Import and use hooks from their own feature (e.g., `useSearch`, `useDelete`).
2. Import and compose multiple subcomponents from their feature.
3. Pass hook state and handlers as props down to subcomponents.
4. Manage container/layout styling (e.g., Tailwind flex, gap, width).
5. Not contain direct API calls or business logic â€” use hooks for that.
6. Be the default export.
7. Be imported by page components as the primary feature UI.

**Example usage:**

```tsx
import { Header, Search, Content, Footer } from "./components";
import { useSearch, useDelete, useFavorite } from "./hooks";

export default function Feature*Page() {
  const { data, loading, params, setParams } = useSearch();
  const { deleteItem } = useDelete();
  const { toggleFavorite } = useFavorite();

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <Header />
      <Search search={params.search} onSearch={setParams} loading={loading} />
      <Content data={data} onDelete={deleteItem} onFavorite={toggleFavorite} />
      <Footer params={params} />
    </div>
  );
}
